# The Human Intent Driven AI Manifesto

## Purpose

AI must exist to preserve and amplify human thinking, not substitute it. Its role is to help people and organizations make their intent explicit, coherent, and reproducible — ensuring humans remain in the driver’s seat of innovation, culture, and progress.

## Commitment

We commit to build tools that question, to design systems that remember why, and to keep humans in the loop - not because we must, but because that’s what makes us human.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intent First

   We start with why.  
   Every feature, task, or line of code begins by defining human intent — the goal, the reason, the constraint.  
   AI must question until intent is unambiguous.  
   Nothing proceeds without clarity.

### 2. Dialogue Over Directives

   AI communicates through questions and reflection, not commands.  
   It challenges, rephrases, and exposes assumptions.  
   It never decides, commits, or acts.  
   Only humans choose direction.

### 3. No Hidden Context

   AI remembers nothing silently.  
   Every piece of context is added consciously by the human, visible and editable.  
   There are no secrets, no background memory — only explicit understanding.

### 4. Intent Lives With Code

   Intent is a first-class artifact.  
   It is versioned, reviewed, and traceable like source code.  
   Each intent contains its why, what, how, and sources —  
   so anyone can understand why things are built this way in five years.

### 5. Reproducibility as Integrity

   Given the same intent, the AI should yield the same result.  
   Drift means unclear thinking or broken alignment.  
   Reproducibility is how we test trust.

### 6. Humans Stay in Charge

   AI facilitates reasoning but never replaces it.  
   Inference is allowed only to clarify, never to choose or optimize.  
   Humans resolve conflicts, own decisions, and remain accountable.
